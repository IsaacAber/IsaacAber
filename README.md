ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Zurhy**, a multiplayer 2D game built with **Phaser.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **Node.js/Express**, and **Socket.IO** for real-time communication.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to present my identity and skills to potential employers and grow as a developer, both technically and professionally.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on real-time applications, multiplayer games, or tools that help simplify processes for users.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Node.js**, **React**, **Phaser.js**, or **game development** in general!

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™ve learned **C#** in school, and my passion for creating Minecraft server plugins got me into **Java**.
